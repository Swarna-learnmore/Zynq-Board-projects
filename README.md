# Zynq-Board-projects
The Zynq architecture, as the latest generation of Xilinx’s all- programmable System-on-Chip (SoC) families, combines a dual- core ARM Cortex-A9 with a traditional (FPGA). Before implementing the ARM processor inside the Zynq device, users were using a soft-core processor such as Xilinx’s Microblaze.

**Why do we need zynq?**

An SoC can combine all aspects of a digital system: processing,
high-speed logic, interfacing, memory, and so on. The SoC solution
is lower cost, enables faster and more secure data transfers
between the various system elements, has higher overall system
speed, lower power consumption, smaller physical size, and better
reliability. In the past, the term SoC has usually referred to
an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC).
The major disadvantages of ASIC-based SoCs are (i) development
time and cost, and (ii) lack of flexibility.
The non-recurring engineering effort (and cost) of developing
an ASIC are significant, making this type of SoC suitable
only for high-volume markets where there is no requirement
for future upgrades.

There is a clear need for a more flexible solution, and this
is what motivates the System-on- Progammable-Chip, a specific
flavour of SoC implemented on a programmable, reconfig
¬urable device. The natural solution has long been the FPGA.
FPGAs can also be reconfigured as often as desired, thus offering
a more fundamentally flexible platform than ASICs for implementing
SoCs. Now, Zynq provides an even more ideal platform
for implementing flexible SoCs: Xilinx markets the device as an
‘All-Programmable SoC’(APSoC), which perfectly captures its
capabilities. Zynq comprises two main parts: a Processing System(
PS) formed around a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor,
and Programmable Logic (PL), which is equivalent to that of an
FPGA. It also features integrated memory, a variety of peripherals,
and high-speed communications interfaces.

**Zynq architecture**

As mentioned above, zynq soc essentially consists of two main
ps and pl. in a Zynq device the PS or processing system (cortex
a9) is connected to the programmable logic using the AXI busses.

Figure 1: A simplified model of zynq architecture.

**Processing system of zynq**

• All Zynq devices have the same basic architecture, and
all of them contain a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor
with 1GHZ clock speed. This is a hard processor which
exists as a dedicated and optimised silicon element on the
device achieves considerably higher performance.

• The alternative to hard processor is a soft processor like
Xilinx microblaze formed by combining elements of the
programmable logic fabric with which number and precise
implementation of the processor instances is flexible.

• The Zynq processing system encompasses a set of associated
processing resources forming an Application Processing
Unit (APU), and further peripheral interfaces,
cache memory, memory interfaces, interconnect, and
clock generation circuitry.

• The APU is primarily comprised of two ARM processing
cores, each with associated computational units: a NEON
Media Processing Engine (MPE) and Floating Point Unit
(FPU), a Memory Management Unit (MMU), and a Level
1 cache memory (for instructions and data) and a Level 2
cache memory, and On Chip Memory.

• A Snoop Control Unit (SCU) forms a bridge between the
ARM cores and the Level 2 cache and OCM memories.
this unit also has some responsibility for interfacing with
the PL.

**Programmable logic (PL) of zynq**

• The programmable logic is based on the Artix-7 and
Kintex-7 FPGA fabric.

• The PL part of the Zynq device is depicted in Figure with
various features highlighted. The PL is predominantly
composed of general purpose FPGA logic fabric, which is
composed of slices and Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs),Memory (RAM); or (iv) a shift register. LUTs can be combined
together to form larger logic functions, memories,
or shift registers, as required.

• Flip-flop (FF): A sequential circuit element implementing
a 1-bit register, with reset functionality. One of the FFs
can optionally be used to implement a latch.

• Switch Matrix : A switch matrix sits next to each CLB,
and provides a flexible routing facility for making connection
between elements within a CLB, and from one CLB
to other resources on the PL.

• Carry logic : Arithmetic circuits require intermediate signals
to be propagated between adjacent slices, and this
is achieved via carry logic. The carry logic comprises a
chain of routes and multiplexers to link slices in a vertical
column.

• Input/Output Blocks (IOBs) — IOBs are resources that
provide interfacing between the PL logic resources, and
the physical device ‘pads’ used to connect to external circuitry.
Each IOB can handle a 1-bit input or output signal.
IOBs are usually located around the perimeter of the device.
