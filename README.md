# Zynq-Board-projects
The Zynq architecture, as the latest generation of Xilinx’s all- programmable System-on-Chip (SoC) families, combines a dual- core ARM Cortex-A9 with a traditional (FPGA). Before implementing the ARM processor inside the Zynq device, users were using a soft-core processor such as Xilinx’s Microblaze.
